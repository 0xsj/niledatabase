Today, we are launching Nile templates, the quickest way to build modern SaaS. Nile is a serverless Postgres database designed for modern SaaS applications. Modern SaaS applications are multi-tenant. Nile virtualizes tenants to enable seamless tenant isolation (data and performance isolation), per-tenant backups, and placement on multi-tenant or dedicated infrastructure anywhere on the planet. You can do all this with the experience of a single Postgres! You don’t have to manage multiple databases, build complex permissions for isolation, or write buggy scripts to read specific tenant data from backups. On top of the tenant model, we provide opt-in user management capabilities, customer-specific vector embeddings, and instant tenant admin dashboards. You can do all of this with very little code. Moreover, Nile's Postgres is built for the cloud, enabling effortless scaling and a true serverless experience. 

Nile templates help developers start with Nile’s Postgres and build their SaaS applications. The templates are focused on specific functionalities or examples of how to build popular, successful, full-blown applications. We will discuss what templates are, our philosophy on what we think templates should cover, and a detailed walkthrough about how to use them. You can **[sign up for our waitlist](https://www.thenile.dev/)** today and try our [templates](https://www.thenile.dev/templates).

We will do a quick walkthrough about how to access and use Nile templates. To follow along, I recommend opening up the templates landing page in another tab. You will see a list of templates that can help you get started. We plan to continue adding more templates and surface community contributions here.

We will use “NextJS application with Nile” template to show how to use the templates. Go ahead and select it.

There are quite a few things to note here. On the left, you can read about what framework was used to build this example, the use case to use it for, and who published the template. When we have community contributions, we would love to highlight folks from the community here. At the bottom, we have a button to see a live demo and another button that takes you to the GitHub repo for this template. On the right, you can see a snapshot of how the example application looks like, and below that, we have instructions on how to quickly run this example locally on your machine.

You can click on the demo and see the hosted application. You can try it out like a regular application. This is all built on Nile’s Postgres. In this particular example, it uses Nile’s tenant isolation and user management capabilities. 

TBD video

Once you are done with the demo and are convinced you want to set this example up locally to start building something, you can go to the repo and clone it locally.

You can then follow the instructions on the template page or the GitHub readme. All the templates can be run locally, and you also have Docker options if you prefer that. Don’t forget to request an invitation to try out Nile before following the instructions. 

TBD video

We also have a video tutorial for each template if you prefer to follow someone teaching how to use our templates and get started. We would love to hear your feedback after trying them on our GitHub discussion forum or our Discord channel.


## Get Started!

The mission of Nile is to enable developers to accelerate the next billion modern SaaS applications. We would love to work with the community to build Nile to be a product that developers love.
