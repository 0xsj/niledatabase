Today, we are launching Nile templates, the quickest way to build modern SaaS. Nile is a serverless Postgres database designed for modern SaaS applications. Modern SaaS applications are multi-tenant. Nile virtualizes tenants to enable seamless tenant isolation (data and performance isolation), per-tenant backups, and placement on multi-tenant or dedicated infrastructure anywhere on the planet. You can do all this with the experience of a single Postgres! You don’t have to manage multiple databases, build complex permissions for isolation, or write buggy scripts to read specific tenant data from backups. On top of the tenant model, we provide opt-in user management capabilities, customer-specific vector embeddings, and instant tenant admin dashboards. You can do all of this with very little code. Moreover, Nile's Postgres is built for the cloud, enabling effortless scaling and a true serverless experience. 

Nile templates help developers start with Nile’s Postgres and build their SaaS applications. The templates are focused on specific functionalities or examples of how to build popular, successful, full-blown applications. We will discuss what templates are, our philosophy on what we think templates should cover, and a detailed walkthrough about how to use them. You can **[sign up for our waitlist](https://www.thenile.dev/)** today and try our [templates](https://www.thenile.dev/templates).
