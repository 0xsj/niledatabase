# Overview
Nile's Postgres is built 100% on Postgres and is protocol and application-compatible with Postgres. However, given it is a serverless database, there are some restrictions that you should be aware of. Nile currently supports Postgres 15.

# Current limitations
The table below lists all the features in Postgres that are not yet supported in Nile's Postgres. We are continuing to work on features focused on SaaS use cases. If you have any feature need, we would love to hear from you. Please add your upvote to existing feature requests or add your own on our [Github discussion](https://github.com/orgs/niledatabase/discussions/categories/feature-requests) forum.
