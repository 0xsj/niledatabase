# Getting started with pg_vector

The **`pg_vector`** extension in PostgreSQL is used to efficiently store and query vector data. The **`pg_vector`** extension provides PostgreSQL with the ability to store and perform operations on vectors directly within the database.

## Create tenant table with vector type

Vector types work like any other standard types. You can make them the type of a column in a tenant table and Nile will take care of isolating the embeddings per tenant.

```jsx
// creating a table to store wiki documents for a Notion like SaaS application
// with vector dimension of 3
CREATE TABLE wiki_documents(
    tenant_id uuid,
    id integer,
    embedding vector(3)
    );
```

## Store vectors per tenant

Once you have the table defined, you would want to populate the embeddings. Typically, this is done by querying a large language model (eg. OpenAI, HuggingFace), retrieving the embeddings and storing them in the vector store. Once stored, the embeddings follow the standard tenant rules. They can be isolated, sharded and placed based on the tenant they belong to.

```jsx
INSERT INTO wiki_documents (tenant_id,id, embedding) 
VALUES ('018ade1a-7843-7e60-9686-714bab650998',1, '[1,2,3]');
```

## Query vectors

pg_vector supports three types of vector similarity operators



You could use any one of them to find the distance between vectors.
