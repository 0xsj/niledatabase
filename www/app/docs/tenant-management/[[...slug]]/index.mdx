## **What is a tenant?**

A tenant is primarily a company, an organization, or a workspace in your product that contains a group of users. A SaaS application provides services to multiple tenants. Tenant is the basic building block of all SaaS applications. Every SaaS feature and experience is built on top of tenants. Nile has built-in tenant virtualization, which makes it easy, reliable, and cost-effective to develop and support SaaS use cases across the globe.

## Creating a tenant

Tenant is the basic building block for SaaS and Nile. Nile’s Postgres comes with a built-in tenant table. This table has built-in columns to support common use cases out of the box but can also be extended to add more application-specific columns.

```sql
select * from tenants;

id | name | created | updated | deleted 
----+------+---------+---------+---------
```

The tenants table has an id that uniquely identifies a tenant, a name of the tenant (customer or workspace etc) and a few other columns for bookkeeping. 

Inserting  a new customer or tenant could use SQL, one of our SDKs or REST APIs. For product led growth companies, your application would typically dynamically create the new customer when they sign up using our SDK or REST APIs. If you are a more sales led product, you can use Nile’s tenant dashboard to add one.

```sql
// create a record for the first customer
insert into tenants (name) VALUES ('customer1');
```

```bash
curl 
```

```jsx

```

You can see how a uuid is automatically inserted into the id column for the customer. This id can be used for all future reference to ‘customer1’.

```sql
select * from tenants;
                  id                  |   name    |          created           |          updated           | deleted 
--------------------------------------+-----------+----------------------------+----------------------------+---------
 018ac98e-b37a-731b-b03a-6617e8fd5266 | customer1 | 2023-09-24 23:38:07.097633 | 2023-09-24 23:38:07.097633 |
```

The insert version shown here is the most simple option. You would be able to specify the location (any supported region in the world) or the deployment mode (place tenants on a dedicated instance) of a tenant for more fine grained control. You would also be able to extend the tenants table to add more metadata (covered in later sections).
