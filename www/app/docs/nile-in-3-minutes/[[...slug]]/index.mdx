## Nile in 3 minutes

Nile is serverless Postgres built for modern SaaS applications. All B2B SaaS applications and most B2C SaaS are multi-tenant. A tenant is primarily a company, an organization, or a workspace in your product that contains a group of users. A SaaS application provides services to multiple tenants. Tenant is the basic building block of all SaaS applications.

Nile virtualizes tenants/customers/organizations into Postgres to enable native tenant data isolation, performance isolation between tenants, per-tenant backups, and tenant placement on shared or dedicated compute globally for latency or compliance. You can do all this with the experience of a single Postgres! You don’t have to manage multiple databases, build complex permissions for isolation, or write buggy scripts to read specific tenant data from backups. On top of the tenant model, we provide opt-in user management capabilities, customer-specific vector embeddings, and instant tenant admin dashboards. Moreover, Nile's Postgres is built for the cloud, enabling effortless scaling and a true serverless experience.

### Benefits for new SaaS applications

1. **Native tenant data isolation** without having to invest in complex application level permissions or hard to use row level security features. Nile provides session level isolation per tenant. We also have plans to provide connection level isolation (separate connection strings per [tenant](http://tenant.us) in the same database which is useful to build separate application for each tenant without the burden of managing multiple databases).

```sql
-- set session context to the tenant you want to access.
set nile.tenant_id = '018ade1a-7830-7981-b23f-f3a7f7b8f09f';
```

2. **Internal customer admin dashboards without having to spend time building custom dashboards and data pipelines for your new SaaS application.** Nile understands tenants and users (if you use our user management or one of our integrations) and we build one for you.

3. **Backups by tenant or customer (coming soon).** You can instantaneously restore data for a specific customer or a group of customers without any complex scripts whether you place tenants in a shared Postgres compute or on dedicated Postgres compute. The challenges mentioned in this [writeup about restoring backups for SaaS applications](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/managed-database-backup-and-recovery-in-a-multi-tenant-saas-application/) is solved for you on Nile.
4. **User management which is built for multitenancy and where you own the user data.** We provide user management SDKs that support organization or tenant management. It also stores the user data your Nile’s Postgres database giving full control.
5. **Understand cost per tenant without any additional instrumentation.** Nile’s billing will provide cost incurred for each of your tenants which helps to better rationalize the revenue per customer and the cost of the database to serve the customer.
6. **Pay for just the queries not compute by default.** On shared Postgres compute, you would pay only for the cost of the queries. This is the default. You can choose dedicated Postgres compute for specific tenants for which you would pay for the provisioned capacity.
7. **No DB shut down or zero cold start time.** We are truly multitenant and provide tenant level isolation. This provides the ability to share resources efficiently and have no cold start time. 
8. **World class developer experience**
    1. World class console which includes query editor, schema viewer, canned examples and more (continuing to improve)
    2. SDKs on top of Postgres to further simplify building SaaS
    3. Templates, tutorials and numerous examples
9. **Integrations for third party applications to launch your SaaS**
    1. Stripe to get billing set up for your application. Our integration provides subscription billing per organization.
    2. NextAuth if you choose to use a popular SDK to do auth. Our integration provides organization/tenant awareness to NextAuth and ensures user data is written into Nile’s Postgres as the source of truth.
    3. Lambda for serverless SaaS applications. 
10. **Free tier limits will not force you into paid tier. You only pay for extra usage.** We provide very attractive limits on our free tier. When you reach the limits, you can simply pay for usage of additional capacity (storage, compute and bandwidth) without being forced into higher tiers. We want you to opt higher tiers for the value we provide and not for additional usage.
11. **Query performance and insights by tenant (coming soon)** We provide all the query performance statistics for each customer. You don’t have to spend hours or days figuring out which customer queries are causing performance issues and which customers are impacted. 
12. You may get benefits listed under “Growing SaaS applications” depending on your use case

Benefits for growing SaaS application

1. Everything under “Benefits for new SaaS applications”
2. Place some tenants on dedicated Postgres compute without the burden of managing multiple databases (schema migration, unified observability, routing) for compliance, security or isolation needs.
3. Place tenants in any region to move data close to the customer for lower latency or compliance needs (eg. GDPR) within one database without the burden of managing multiple databases (schema migration, unified observability, routing).
4. Move tenants instantaneously from shared Postgres compute to dedicated Postgres compute or to another region
